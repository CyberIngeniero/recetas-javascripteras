üëâ Requires the following package https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js

```js
import EXIF from 'exif-js';

export default function(blob) {
  // next 2 lines thanks to to https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolangonzalez/
  if (!blob || !(blob instanceof Blob)) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(new Error('No blob')));
  }
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    EXIF.getData(blob, function() {
      resolve(EXIF.getTag(this, 'Orientation'));
    });
  });
}
```
