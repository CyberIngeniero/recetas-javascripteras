# 🆙 Variable hoisting

Language feature that automatically declares variables to the top of the functional / global block


```js
console.log(user); // "undefined" but not error
var user = {};
```

👀 This is Javascript "sees" the previous code:

```js
var user;
console.log(user);
user = {};
```

😲 There is also "Function hoisting" when we declare a function:

```js
foo();
function foo() {
  alert('it works!');
};
```

❗️But this does not work if we assign a function to a variable:

```js
foo();

var foo = function() {
  alert('it works!');
};

❌ Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function 
```

🚫 Variables declared with let / const suffer hoisting but are put in the Temporal Dead Zone, so they cannot be used until they are defined

```js
console.log(user);
const user = {};

// ❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'user' before initialization 
```
