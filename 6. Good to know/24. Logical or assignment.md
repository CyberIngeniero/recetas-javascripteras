# Logical OR assignment (||=)

It is a short circuit equivalent to the operation: `x || (x = y);`.

📍This operator allows us to visualize a default value in the event that the variable contains a falsy value.

👉That is the reason why the property `title`, which initially contains an empty string, that is, a value that evaluates to `false`, points to the string `title is empty` in the second case.

```js
const a = { duration: 50, title: "" };

a.duration ||= 10;
console.log(a.duration);
// expected output: 50

a.title ||= "title is empty.";
console.log(a.title);
// expected output: "title is empty"
```
