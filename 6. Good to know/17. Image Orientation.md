# üôÉ Get image orientation üôÉ

üëâ Requires the following package https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js

```js
import EXIF from 'exif-js';

export default function(blob) {
  if (!blob) {
    return new Promise(resolve => resolve(1));
  }
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    EXIF.getData(blob, function() {
      resolve(EXIF.getTag(this, 'Orientation'));
    });
  });
}
```
