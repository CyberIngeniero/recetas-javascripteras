# üé¢ Event Loop

## Macrotasks

Tasks which are programmed so that the browser can guarantee that they are executed sequentially when accessing the Javascript engine. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThe main script is a macrotask.

## Callback queue

Queue for store the pending callbacks for the event handlers (like `onClick`) or the `setTimeout` or `setInterval` functions. These callbacks are considered **macrotasks**.

```js
function callbackForTimeout() { 
  console.log('This function comes from the callback queue and is a new macrotask');
}
setTimeout(callbackForTimeout, 3000);
```

## Microtasks

Tasks which are programmed for things that should happen immediately after the macrotask that is currently running, such as performing something asynchronous without incurring the penalty of creating a new macrotask.

## Microtask queue

**Microtasks** are queued in the microtask queue which is processed after the macrotask queue and at the end of the execution of each macrotask.

The **callbacks of the Promise objects** are microtasks.

```js
console.log('start');  
Promise.resolve()
  .then(function() {   
    console.log('(1) this comes from the microtask queue'); 
  })
  .then(function() {   
    console.log('(2) this also comes from the microtask queue'); 
  });  
console.log('end');
// start
// end
// (1) this comes from the microtask queue
// (2) this also comes from the microtask queue
```

## Execution order

1. First, Javascript engine checks if there are any tasks available in the **macrotaks** queue.
2. If so and that task is running, wait until it completes before going to the next step. If not, go directly to step 3.
3. Then run all the **microtasks** that are in the microtask queue.
4. In the event that during the execution of the microtasks we add new microtasks, these are also executed.

### Final example

```js
console.log('start');
setTimeout(function() {
    // remember, this callback is a macrotasks
    console.log('timeout finished'); 
}, 0);
Promise.resolve()
  .then(function() {
    console.log('promise 1'); 
  })
  .then(function() {   
    console.log('promise 2'); 
  });  
console.log('end');
// start
// end
// promise 1
// promise 2
// timeout finished
```
