# Replace switch with object

This is a shortcut to replace the switch with objects. The idea is to make each instance a property of the object and directly access the value through the object.

```js
const animal = "dog";

switch (animal) {
  case "dog":
    console.log("Si si si, simba! 🎺");
    break;
  case "cat":
    console.log("Me pareció ver un lindo gatito");
    break;
}
// 'Si si si, simba! 🎺'

const logAnimal = {
  dog: () => console.log("Si si si, simba! 🎺"),
  cat: () => console.log("Me pareció ver un lindo gatito"),
};

logAnimal[animal]();
// 'Si si si, simba! 🎺'
```

🚀 As you can see, we have gained a lot in readability, although right now "switch" prevails in performance. In the latest versions of Chrome, this operator wins when we face situations with many cases.

⚖️ As always, it's about finding the balance between readability and performance. For small "switches", use the shape that you like best. For tricky cases, heal yourself using switch (although the syntax is worse).
