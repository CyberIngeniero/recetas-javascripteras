# 🕵🏼 findLast

The `findLast()` method **iterates the array in reverse order** and returns the value of the first element that satisfies the provided testing function.

If no elements satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

```js
const ages = [5, 12, 30, 36, 50, 62, 13];
const found = ages.findLast((a) => a > 30);
console.log(found);
// expected output: 62
```
