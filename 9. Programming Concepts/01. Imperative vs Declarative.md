# 🗡 Imperative Programming vs Declarative Programming

## Imperative Programming

We specify each of the steps that must be done to perform a certain action.
👉: 1️⃣ ➡️ 2️⃣ ➡️ 3️⃣

**Example**. Get odd numbers from an array with imperative style

```js
const allNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const imperativeOddNumbers = [];

// 1️⃣ Iterates over the array of numbers
for (let number of allNumbers) {
  // 2️⃣ Check if it is odd
  if (number % 2 !== 0) {
    // 3️⃣ Add the number to the array
    imperativeOddNumbers.push(number);
  }
}
```

## Declarative Programming.

We declare in an abstract way each one of the tasks to be carried out and the language is in charge of carrying them out.
📄 🙏

**Example**. Get odd numbers from an array with declarative style

```js
const isOdd = number => number % 2 !== 0;
// 🙏 Filter the array based on the isOdd function
const declarativeOddNumbers = allNumbers.filter(isOdd);
```
