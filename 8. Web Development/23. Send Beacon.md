# Navigator.sendBeacon()

The `navigator.sendBeacon()` method asynchronously sends an HTTP POST request containing a small amount of data to a web server.

Its main purpose is to send analytics lightweight information or diagnostics code.

## Why is this method useful?

When sending analytics, we often want to send them when the user goes out of the page. In this situation, the browse may choose not to send asynchronous `XMLHttpRequest` requests. `navigator.sendBeacon()` solves this problem.

## Signature

```js
sendBeacon(url, data);
```

### Arguments

- `url` can be absolute or relative.

- `data` can be an `ArrayBuffer`, a `TypedArray`, a `DataView`, a `Blob`, a string literal or object, a `FormData` or a `URLSearchParams` object.

## Example

```js
const analyticsData = {
  user: "XXX",
};

// relative
navigator.sendBeacon("/log", analyticsData);

// absolute

navigator.sendBeacon("https://myserver.com/log", analyticsData);
```
